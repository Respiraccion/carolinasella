# 🧠 Domain Memory & Learnings

This file serves as the **Persistent Memory** for the project. Agents MUST read this before starting work and update it after finishing.

## 🟢 Successful Workflows
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Merged `README.md` into `AGENTS.md` to centralize agent instructions and site specs. Root `README.md` and one-use scripts were deleted to keep the environment clean.
- **Styling Strategy**: Priority is given to the WordPress Site Editor and `theme.json` to empower the user. `style.css` is reserved for complex overrides.

## 🔴 Struggles & Blockers
- **Documentation Dissonance**: Multiple files previously pointed to non-existent `DOCS/README.md`. Centralized everything in `AGENTS.md` and `DOCS/01-TODOS.xml` to resolve this.
