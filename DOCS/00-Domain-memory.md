# 🧠 Domain Memory & Learnings

This file serves as the **Persistent Memory** for the project. Agents MUST read this before starting work and update it after finishing.

## 🟢 Successful Workflows
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Merged `README.md` into `AGENTS.md` to centralize agent instructions and site specs.
- **Styling Strategy**: Priority is WordPress Site Editor → theme.json → style.css (last resort).
- **Workflow Optimization (2026-01-17)**: Created beginner-friendly documentation:
  - `DECISION-TREE.md`: Quick "where do I change X" routing
  - `03-WORDPRESS-GUIDE.md`: Step-by-step WordPress instructions
  - Updated `AGENTS.md` with clear Human vs Agent task separation
  - Added TOC to `style.css` for navigation
  - **Decision**: Stay with Twenty Twenty-Five theme (avoid Elementor migration)

## 🔴 Struggles & Blockers
- **Documentation Dissonance**: Multiple files previously pointed to non-existent docs. Centralized everything in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Beginner Confusion**: Programmer was confused about image sizes, styling locations. Resolved with DECISION-TREE.md workflow.
